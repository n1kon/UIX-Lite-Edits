# UIX-Lite-Edits
Based on verstion 0.4

Added ability to change the Launcher menu orb to a custom tga image. You can set it via Settings/UIX Settings/General Settings then selecting through the Launcher Orb icon setting.

Icon must be named "customlogo" and bulit in tga format.

For ease of use for now, convert your "customlogo.tga" image to .xbx and add it to the default.xip along with the edited default.xap and config.xap files and your all set.

I have added a demo "customlogo.tga" for size reference (512pxx512px) and testing purpose.
